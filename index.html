        <h3>So what's this nSDL thing about?</h3>

<p>nSDL is a port of SDL for the TI-Nspire calculator. If you're unsure what SDL is, here's a short summary from the official website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D video framebuffer. It is used by MPEG playback software, emulators, and many popular games, including the award winning Linux port of "Civilization: Call To Power."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In much more general terms, nSDL makes game development on the TI-Nspire a lot easier (although it is not restricted for games only). It also allows computer programs that use SDL (some examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_using_SDL">here</a> and <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/games.php?order=name&amp;category=-1&amp;completed=0&amp;os=-1&amp;match_name=&amp;perpage=-1">here</a>) to be ported to the said calculator.</p>

<p>Its features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full one-binary-for-all support on every TI-Nspire (CAS &amp; non-CAS) calculatorâ€”Clickpad, Touchpad &amp; CX.</li>
<li>Very fast &amp; stable buffered drawing.</li>
<li>Supports all graphics-related functions, events, non-threaded timer functions, and more.</li>
<li>Supports 8- and 16-bit display bit depth.</li>
<li>Based on the robust SDL 1.2.13.</li>
</ul><p>nSDL is the port of SDL to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-Nspire_series">TI-Nspire</a> calculators. If you're unsure what SDL is, here's a short summary from the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">official website</a>:</p>

<h3>Alrighty then, what now?</h3>

<p>If you're new to TI-Nspire development and/or want to know how to easily set up your Ndless/SDL environment, move on to the <a href="https://github.com/Hoffa/nSDL/wiki/How-to-guide">how-to guide</a>. Once you're ready, you might want to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Hoffa/nSDL/wiki/Starting-game-programming-on-the-TI-Nspire">TI-Nspire game programming introduction</a>.</p>

<p>There might also be some useful pieces of information on the <a href="https://github.com/Hoffa/nSDL/wiki">wiki</a>, so make sure to check it out.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>You might be tempted to click on one of the attractive folders up there, but they are only for those interested in the source code. If you're looking for the files necessary to make your own SDL programs on the TI-Nspire, grab the latest nSDL build below:</p>
