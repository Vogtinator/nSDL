If you're unsure what SDL is, here's a short summary from the official website:\r\n\r\n>Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D video framebuffer. It is used by MPEG playback software, emulators, and many popular games, including the award winning Linux port of \"Civilization: Call To Power.\"\r\n\r\nIn much more general terms, nSDL makes game development on the TI-Nspire a lot easier (although it is not restricted for games only). It also allows computer programs that use SDL (some examples [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_using_SDL) and [here](http://www.libsdl.org/games.php?order=name&category=-1&completed=0&os=-1&match_name=&perpage=-1)) to be ported to the said calculator.\r\n\r\nIts features include:\r\n\r\n* Full one-binary-for-all support on every TI-Nspire (CAS & non-CAS) calculatorâ€”Clickpad, Touchpad & CX.\r\n* Very fast & stable buffered drawing.\r\n* Supports all graphics-related functions, events, non-threaded timer functions, and more.\r\n* Supports 8- and 16-bit display bit depth.\r\n* Based on the robust SDL 1.2.13.\r\n\r\nnSDL is the port of SDL to the [TI-Nspire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-Nspire_series) calculators.

Once you're ready, you might want to take a look at the [TI-Nspire game programming introduction](https://github.com/Hoffa/nSDL/wiki/Starting-game-programming-on-the-TI-Nspire).\r\n\r\nThere might also be some useful pieces of information on the [wiki](https://github.com/Hoffa/nSDL/wiki), so make sure to check it out.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nYou might be tempted to click on one of the attractive folders up there, but they are only for those interested in the source code.
